### **About**

This web app provides a user-friendly interface to predict multiple diseases based on various input features. The machine learning models used in this application are trained on relevant datasets to make accurate predictions.

The diseases currently supported by this web app include:

  *  Diabetes
  *  Parkinson's disease
  *  Heart disease

### Usage
1. Run the web app:
   
    `streamlit run app.py`
  
2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to access the web app.

3. Select the disease prediction page you want to use and provide the required input features.

4. Click on the Test Result button to generate the prediction result.

### **Models**

The machine learning models used in this web app are trained on publicly available datasets specific to each disease. Here is a brief description of each model:

 * Diabetes Model: This model predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on input features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc.

 * Parkinson's Disease Model: This model predicts the presence of Parkinson's disease in a person based on features extracted from voice recordings.

 * Heart Disease Model: This model predicts the presence of heart disease based on various clinical and demographic features of a person.
